This is personal page of Miika Lepp√§nen. Here I promote ideas which I think are worth spreading and share notes about software development.

## Software eats the world

In the WSJ [article](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html) Marc Andreessen explains why the software is eating the world. What this basically means is that every business should be improving their workflows(with software) or be left behind.


## About notes

[Notes](notes/index.html) section contains tutorials, links to resources, installation instructions etc. I try to keep them up to date.
