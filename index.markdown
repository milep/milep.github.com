This page reflects my current perspectives on product development, informed by ongoing experience and learning. It will be periodically updated to incorporate new insights.

_This is still WIP_


In product development, the key question is 'What to Build?' This involves understanding user needs beyond their explicit requests and having a strong vision. Visionary thinking is crucial, especially when building a new product. Product developers must listen to users, but need to consider the feedback against their broader vision. A fast feedback loop between the developers, domain experts, and users is essential. There are many product discovery methods and frameworks that can help you to find what to build. Essentially those come down to talking to customers, good communication and fast feedback loops with all the stakeholders.

Once you have figured out how to determine what to build, you need people to build it. You should have an inspired and competent team, that is cross-functional and communicates well. Usually there are some business stakeholders, a product manager, a designer and engineers. The team should be empowered to have autonomy and ownership of the product. That is motivating and leads to better outcomes. A good team can find processes that work well for them by themselves, but there are also some well-established best practices.

As the project progresses, the organizational structure becomes increasingly critical. Initially, a flat structure may be advantageous for smaller teams, enhancing communication and agility. However, as the team grows, addressing the developer lifecycle becomes essential. Experienced developers often seek new challenges, sometimes outside the current organization. A good leader should anticipate and encourage this, especially if suitable roles within the organization are unavailable. Consequently, it's wise to prepare emerging team members for larger roles, ensuring a seamless transition and continued project momentum.
