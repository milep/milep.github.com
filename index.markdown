## Software eats the world

In the WSJ [article](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html) Marc Andreessen explains why the software is eating the world. What this basically means is that every business should be improving their workflows(with software) or be left behind.


## Fixed price contract is good for routine projects

But if your project involves something that has not been done before(by project members), you really should consider using other kind of contract. Because it's a known fact that time estimation for software projects is hard. Errors can be off by an order of magnitude. Simplified implications of this is that either you end up paying too much(project took less time than anticipated, rare) or you get low quality(supplier has to cut corners to make profit). In the worst case the supplier can go to bankruptcy and you end up with unfinished project.

List of [10 good reasons](http://www.giftrocket.com/why-marketing-bd-should-learn-to-code). In short, it helps you to save time by automation, gain respect from programmers and you can build a prototype of your next project by yourself.
