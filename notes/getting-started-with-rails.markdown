If you are familiar with programming and web technologies, here are some links to get started with rails.

For the impatient, first go through the tutorial in the [tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org) and then head to the [Rails for Zombies](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-for-zombies). Both can be done in the browser, so you don't have to install anything.

## Ruby

* [Installing for Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/)
* [Installing for OS X and Linux](http://beginrescueend.com/)
* [Documentation and API docs](http://www.ruby-doc.org/)
* [Ruby the language](http://www.ruby-lang.org)
* [Try Ruby in your browser](http://tryruby.org)

## Rails

* [Official guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/)
* [API docs](http://api.rubyonrails.org/)
* Very good [screencasts about Rails](http://railscasts.com/)
* [Fun Rails tutorial](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-for-zombies)
* [Rails tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book)

## Editors and IDEs

You really don't need a fancy IDE, your favorite text editor and command line tools gets you far enough.

### Commercial

* [RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/index.html)
* [Textmate](http://macromates.com/)

### Free

* [NetBeans](www.netbeans.org) (As separate plugin?)
* [RadRails](http://www.aptana.com/products/radrails)
* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
* [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/index.html)
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) (help yourself)
* Emacs for [Windows](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/Getting-Emacs.html#Getting-Emacs), [OS X](installing-emacs.html), [Linux](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

My choice is Emacs on OS X, here are some installation and configuration [instructions](installing-emacs.html) for it.


## Libraries for the Ruby

Ruby libraries are called [gems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems)
After you are familiar with Rails, here are some gems which I find useful:

* User authentication with devise. If your users need to register or you have an admin interface.
* User authorization with cancan. If your users has different roles eg. regular users and administrators.
* Database record management with rails_admin.
